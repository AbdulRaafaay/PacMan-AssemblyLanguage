- **Teleporters (T)** - In Level 3 only  

## Requirements
- MASM (Microsoft Macro Assembler)  
- Irvine32 library  
- Winmm.lib for sound effects  
- Windows operating system  

## How to Run

### Visual Studio (Recommended)
1. Install [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) with the **Desktop Development with C++** workload.
2. Set up the **Irvine32 library**:
- Download it from [kipirvine.com](https://www.kipirvine.com/asm/examples/index.htm).
- Copy `Irvine32.inc` to your VS `Include` directory.
- Copy `Irvine32.lib`, `kernel32.lib`, `user32.lib`, `winmm.lib` to your `Lib` directory.
- Ensure `Irvine32.obj` is available in the project directory or properly referenced.
3. Create a new **Win32 Console Project** in Visual Studio.
4. Add `pacman.asm` to the project.
5. Configure project settings:
- Add include/lib directories to **VC++ Directories**.
- Add `irvine32.lib`, `kernel32.lib`, `user32.lib`, and `winmm.lib` to **Linker > Input > Additional Dependencies**.
6. Build and run the project (**Ctrl + F5**).

> ‚ùó Make sure you are using the x86 build configuration (not x64), as the Irvine32 library is 32-bit only.

## Game Progression
1. **Level 1**:
- 2 ghosts
- Basic maze layout
- Score target: 500 points to advance

2. **Level 2**:

- Teleportation points
- Game completes at 3000 points

## Sound Effects
The game includes several sound effects:
- Pacman beginning sound  
- Ghost collision sound  
- Point collection sound  
- Game over sound  

## Files
- `pacman.asm` - Main game source code  
- `Name_Score.txt` - File created to store player name and score  

## Notes
- The game was developed using the Irvine32 library for Windows  
- Sound effects require `winmm.lib`  
- The code includes extensive comments explaining the functionality  

Enjoy the game!
